# QR Code Generator
### QR Code Generator

This is a simple QR code generator project implemented using JavaScript, Node.js, and npm packages like "inquirer" and "qr-image".

## Description

This project allows users to generate QR codes for any text input provided by the user. It utilizes the "qr-image" npm package to generate QR codes and "inquirer" package for a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) to input text.
